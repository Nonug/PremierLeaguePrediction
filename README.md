# STAT3612 Project - Predicting Premium League Winning Team

## Appendix

Hello and welcome to our project's GitHub repository. Essentially we have opted for using this as our Appendix, as it saves the pdf document from being over 50 pages long!
Documents of interest are:
  -> Data Profile Reports: here you can observe what the dataset looked like before undergoing the cleaning process and after
  -> All RMD files showcasing code for different aspects of the project

[EDA.rmd](./EDA.Rmd): EDA walkthrough
[Model_training.rmd](./Model_training.rmd): Model Training
